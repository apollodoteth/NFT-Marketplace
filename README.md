**Introduction**
 This Document is to discuss the architecture of the NFT Marketplace and the Voting Dapp. We are going to have Four Smart Contracts Connected to our Dapp, The DAO contract,NFT Contract,Marketplace Contract and the Community Contract.

**Scope**
 The DAPP features an NFT marketplace with minting capabilities for users to create NFTs with metadata and voting attributes. It includes a interface where users can buy,sell and auction NFTs or secure buying and selling, and auction options. Additionally, there is an on-chain voting system with a proposal dashboard for governance, voting mechanisms tied to NFTs owned by a user,these NFTs can come in various tiers.automated execution of decisions can be made through voting using smart contracts. Also Users who originally minted a particular NFT will have royalties which includes a certain percentage of the money made from the sale of the NFT. we will have to decide on that 

 **System Overview**

High-Level Architecture: This has to be discussed amongst ourselves

 **Components**

   NFT Marketplace
 
**Description**
    
 The purpose is the make trading seamless and to ensure user experince is top notch. not forgeting the functionalities and unique features.

   **Technologies**
    
technologies used for building Solidity for smart contracts, IPFS for decentralized storage, and Nextjs for the frontend.

Smart Contracts: smart contract used for minting NFTs, managing transactions, and ensuring security will have to be taken note of.

**On-Chain Voting System**

Description: lets discuss on how the on-chain voting system wll be like including how it integrates with the NFT marketplace.

**Interactions**

User Interaction Flow: Describe the flow of interactions between users, the NFT marketplace, and the on-chain voting system.
APIs and Services: Document any APIs or services used for communication between the frontend, backend, and blockchain.

 **Security and Privacy.**
 
Security Measures: Lets Outline the security measures implemented, including smart contract security practices, user authentication, and data privacy.

Privacy Considerations: how user privacy will be protected, especially in relation to NFT ownership and voting
